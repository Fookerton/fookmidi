This is a collection of midis composed by B. Morton (Fookerton) over the course 2019-2023. A Roland GS soundset is recommended for playback. Included is a soundfont (gm.sf2), basically a decent version of the msgs wavetable, for use with a soft synth. Most files will sound best played back in this manner.
